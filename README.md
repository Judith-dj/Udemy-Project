# Udemy-Website

This is a simple Udemy website clone created using HTML and CSS. This project aims to replicate the basic structure and design elements of the popular Udemy platform. It's a great way to practice web development skills and create a clean, responsive layout. I hava added some features like responsive design that works across different screen sizes and adding simple animations.

Technologies Used
-HTML for structuring the webpage.
-CSS for styling and layout management.

Thanks for visiting my project!
